Lab : "Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine"
Lab objective:
                - Initialize App Engine.
                - Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.
                - Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.
                - Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.

SETUP the environment:

1. In GCP console of the project, on the top right toolbar, click the Open Cloud Shell button
2. click continue and Google cloud shell will provides you with command-line 
        access to your cloud resources directly from your browser.

3. set the default project to the one in which you want to enable the API:

        gcloud config set project qwiklabs-gcp-00-b6c55a51b38d

4. list the active account name with this command:

        gcloud auth list

5. list the project ID with this command:

        gcloud config list project


INITIALIZE the App Engine:

6. Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region

        gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

7. Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory

        git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

8.  Navigate to the source directory

    cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world


Run Hello World application locally

9. Execute the following command to download and update the packages list

    sudo apt-get update

10. Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application

    sudo apt-get install virtualenv

    If prompted [Y/n], press Y and then Enter

    virtualenv -p python3 venv

11. Activate the virtual environment

    source venv/bin/activate

12. Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies

    pip install  -r requirements.txt

13. Run the application

    python main.py

14. In Cloud Shell, click Web preview (Web Preview) > Preview on port 8080 to preview the application

15. To end the test, return to Cloud Shell and press Ctrl+C to abort the deployed service.

Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine:

16. Navigate to the source directory

    cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

17. Deploy your Hello World application

    gcloud app deploy

    If prompted "Do you want to continue (Y/n)?", press Y and then Enter

18. Launch your browser to view the app at http://qwiklabs-gcp-00-b6c55a51b38d.appspot.com

    gcloud app browse

Disable the application with: 

    gcloud app versions stop
